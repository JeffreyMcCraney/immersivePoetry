Bringing poetry to life

Immersive Poetry is a project by Jeffrey McCraney. His goal is to create an immersive experience by combining poetry and digital media. A new poem will be released biweekly. All poems are written by their respective authors and all web design/development is done by Jeffrey McCraney.
